# Movie Recommendation System Documentation
# 1. Overview:
👉The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user input. It utilizes a dataset containing movie information such as titles, overviews, and genres.

# 2. Dependencies:

This system requires the following dependencies:

👉Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

👉Scikit-learn: For text vectorization and cosine similarity computation.
# 3. Functionality:
👉Data Loading: The system loads the movie dataset from a CSV file.

👉Data Exploration: Provides summary statistics, missing values, and column information of the dataset.

👉Feature Selection: Selects relevant features (id, title, overview, genre) and combines them into a single feature called 'tags'.

👉Text Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

👉Cosine Similarity: Computes cosine similarity between vectorized text data to measure similarity between movies.

👉Recommendation: Recommends similar movies based on user input using cosine similarity scores.

# 4. Usage:
👉Load Data: Load the movie dataset from a CSV file using the load_data function.

👉Data Exploration: Explore the dataset using the data_exploration function.

👉Feature Selection: Select relevant features using the feature_selection function.

👉Text Vectorization: Vectorize text data using the text_vectorization function.

👉Compute Similarity: Compute cosine similarity between vectors using the compute_similarity function.

👉Recommendation: Provide movie recommendations based on user input using the recommend_movies function.

# 5. How i developed this:
👉Load the dataset and explore the data to understand its structure.

👉Select relevant features and combine them into a single feature.

👉Vectorize the text data using CountVectorizer.

👉Compute cosine similarity between vectors to measure similarity.

👉Input a movie title to get personalized recommendations.


# 6. Future Improvements:

👉Implement user-based or item-based collaborative filtering for more personalized recommendations.

👉Incorporate additional features such as actors, directors, and release years for better recommendation accuracy.
